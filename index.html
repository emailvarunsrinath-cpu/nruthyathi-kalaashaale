    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
      NRUTHYATHI KALAASHAALE stands as a beacon for the preservation and propagation of Indian arts, culture, and heritage. Founded by the Bharatanatyam Artist, Smt. Anusha Varun, the institution represents an unwavering dedication to fostering a deep appreciation for Indian classical arts. Since its inception in 2008, NRUTHYATHI KALAASHAALE has been instrumental in imparting the timeless art of Bharatanatyam to over 500 students in Mysore, with an additional 20 students from across the globe benefiting from its teachings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the meticulous guidance of Guru Smt. Anusha Varun, NRUTHYATHI KALAASHAALE has witnessed remarkable milestones. Over 150 students have successfully passed Junior exams, while more than 80 students have excelled in Senior exams. Notably, 10 students have achieved Vidwath level certification hosted by Karnataka Secondary Education Examination Board, a testament to the institution's commitment to excellence in classical dance education.
    </p>
    <p>
      The institution's impact extends beyond the classroom, as evidenced by its vibrant presence in the cultural landscape. NRUTHYATHI KALAASHAALE has organized five annual festivals, named Samaagama. It is also providing a platform for students to showcase their talents on prestigious stages such as Sutur Jathre Mahothsav, Kalabhivardhana, Nruthyopasana, Nruthyothsava, and Chiguru Sanje in Mysuru. Additionally, the institution has graced renowned events like Maha Mastakabhisheka in Shravanbela Gola and Shiva Rathri Utsava in Nanjangud, enriching these occasions with the grace and beauty of Bharatanatyam.
    </p>
    <p>
      A hallmark achievement for NRUTHYATHI KALAASHAALE was the highly acclaimed Bharatanatyam Rangapravesam of Aisiri D in December 2023, which captivated audiences with its artistry and finesse. Building upon this success, the institution is currently preparing for a unique Bharatanatyam Rangapravesam featuring a trio of Mother and Daughters, slated for August 2024. This innovative endeavour underscores NRUTHYATHI KALAASHAALE's commitment to pushing the boundaries of classical dance performance while celebrating familial bonds and tradition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, in a testament to the institution's legacy of excellence, senior students of NRUTHYATHI KALAASHAALE have embarked on the journey of imparting Bharatanatyam education independently, thereby continuing the rich heritage of this ancient art form.

      NRUTHYATHI KALAASHAALE takes immense pride in nurturing the passion and dedication of its students towards Bharatanatyam dance and Indian traditions.
